## Step 2
I downloaded the code using the following command

curl url_of_code >> main.py

This will copy the code in the file main.py

## Step 4
Run the program and install libraries that it asks for.

## Step 5
Generate requirements.txt using the following command

pip freze > requirements.txt

## Step 6
Commit and push the changes.

## How will code work on other machines
The code will work on other machines is we make virtual environments and add proper requirements.txt to install dependencies.
